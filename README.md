## Transformer-Based Scene Classification in Remote Sensing

This project applies Vision Transformers (ViT) for high-resolution remote sensing scene classification using the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. It includes model training, optimization, and deployment through a web application.

## Objectives

- Train and fine-tune a pre-trained ViT model on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset.
- Apply model optimization techniques such as pruning, quantization, or knowledge distillation.
- Deploy the optimized model using a Flask web interface.
